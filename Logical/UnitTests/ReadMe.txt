The AS solution 'UnitTest' provides support for repeatable call tests.
It includes test routines that call library functions with defined input values, check the returned outputs, and generate a report.
If an output does not match the expected result, it is noted in the report.

All test routines can be executed with just a few clicks, allowing for quick verification of compatibility and functionality after changes or enhancements to a function. This contributes to improved software quality.

For the example usage of the tested library, the UnitTests are not relevant.
