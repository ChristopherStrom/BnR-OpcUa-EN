Revision History

2018-08-24 | AS4.1
Server:

Task 'ServerData':
Provides partially changing variables via the OPC UA server.
Provides variables that clients can write to.
Client:

Tasks 'ClientC' and 'ClientST':
Establish a connection.
Determine the NamespaceIndex.
Create 3 subscriptions with monitored items.
Cyclic reading of a variable list.
Cyclic writing of a variable list.
Determine and evaluate the connection status.
Disconnect on exit.
2018-08-24 | AS4.2
General:

Use of the roles/user system for OPC UA.
Use of a custom certificate (valid for 99 years) for the server and client.
Client:

Tasks 'ClientC' and 'ClientST':
Add monitored items via 'UA_MonitoredItemAddList' instead of 'UA_MonitoredItemAdd.'
2018-08-24 | AS4.3
Server:

Tasks 'SrvMethC' and 'SrvMethST':
Implementation of the 'Calculate' method.
Client:

Tasks 'ClientC' and 'ClientST':
Cyclic invocation of the 'Calculate' method.
2018-08-24 | AS4.4
OpcUaAny:

Implementation of a hardware client that only requires parameterization instead of programming.
2018-11-19 | AS4.1, AS4.2, AS4.3, AS4.4
Client:

Tasks 'ClientC' and 'ClientST':
Removed releasing node handles required for subscriptions from the step chain.
Explanation: If the connection was interrupted and re-established, values were no longer written to mapped variables.
Handles should not be deleted as long as their associated functionality is required.
2018-11-21 | AS4.4.6.71
Server:

Tasks 'SrvMethC' and 'SrvMethST':
Due to a bug in AS4.4.6.71 (error 5091), the original 'OpcUaSample44' project couldn't compile.
Created a new example project, 'OpcUaSample44_671,' as a workaround.
Bug: Method arguments mapped to variables must only reside on the 1st structure level.
2019-06-07 | AS4.4.7.144
Server:

Tasks 'SrvMethC' and 'SrvMethST':
Fixed the above bug. Reverted to the original 'OpcUaSample44' project, now saved as 'OpcUaSample44_7144.'
2019-01-09 | AS4.5

Same version as AS4.4.
Bug from '2018-11-21 AS4.4.6.71' resolved.
Variables can now map to method arguments beyond the 1st structure level.
Revised several 'ReadMe.txt' files.
2019-07-05 | AS4.6
Server:

Task 'ServerData':
Added dynamic array examples: ByteStringExample, ByteStringExample20, and DynamicStructArray.
Tasks 'SrvEvntC' and 'SrvEvntST':
Example for user-triggered event firing.
Text system:
Translated the 'Description' attribute for nodes 'gVarsGlobal' and 'VarsLocal.'
Client:

Tasks 'ClientC' and 'ClientST':
Added subscription to receive server-triggered events.
UaCerts:

Tasks 'UaCertsC' and 'UaCertsST':
Demonstrated runtime management of OPC UA certificates.
2019-07-22 | AS4.6 (Custom Data Model)
Server:

Task 'AirCond':
Implemented 3 air conditioner instances via a custom model, modeled entirely in the external UaModeler tool.
2019-09-20 | AS4.7
AirCond (Custom Model):

New custom model created. Maintained data structure, changed parameterization.
Forward references were removed; mapping now uses backward references set in AS.
OpcUaAny:

NamespaceIndex for B&R model shifted from 6 to 7. Updated browse paths.
ServerData:

Overhauled dynamic array examples.
Note on AS4.8

No Sample48 as no major new features were introduced. Only bug fixes and performance optimizations.
2021-03-25 | AS4.9

Added Publisher/Subscriber example.
FireEvent Bug:

Temporary workaround for an issue in A4.90.
2021-09-14 | AS4.9 (BrbLibUa)

Switched from AR A4.90 to E4.90.
Expanded with 'BrbLibUa' library examples.
2022-05-13 | AS4.10 (BrbLibUa V1.01)

Updated from AR E4.90 to D4.91.
2022-06-07 | AS4.10 (BrbLibUa V1.02)

Added unit tests for BrbLibUa.
Improved software quality with ClangTidy analysis.
2024-02-22 | AS4.10 (BrbLibUa V1.03)

Updated BrbLib to V5.03.
Corrected client task error handling.
Client Tasks:

Added note: cyclic reading (polling) should never be implemented in an application.
